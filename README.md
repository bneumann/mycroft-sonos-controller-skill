Fill this out with your appropriate information and hit the `save` button.

When Spotify music service is selected Mycroft will speak to you with a URL and code to follow. This URL is https://sonos.smartgic.io/CODE where `CODE` will be automatically and randomly generated by Mycroft and spoken to you *(e.g. Visit sonos.smartgic.io/BDJBAU)*.

This link will redirect you to the Sonos/Spotify authentication login page using `https` protocol.

Once you successfully logged to Spotify, enter the same code as provided before into the `Link Code` field. Mycroft will confirm the configuration and gives you some example of what you could say.
